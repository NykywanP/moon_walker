# Moon Walker ðŸŒ“  ðŸŒ˜

## Project Motivations
This is my second project with General Assembly. We have been working on some backend software development. like SQL, node, and express. Also we were required to use an API. I have always been a space codet and love to explore anything outside of our atmosphere. The idea of this project is to provide information about the early year Apollo programs. Nasa has a free API in which you can pull raw data about the moon landings. 


## What is includes in this Project

1. Sequelize user model / migration
2. Settings for PostgreSQL
3. Passport and passport-local for authentication
4. Sessions to keep user logged in between pages
6. Flash messages for errors and successes
7. Passwords that are hashed with BCrypt
8. EJS Templating and EJS Layouts

## API Used
Nasa Open APIs ```https://api.nasa.gov/``` You have to create a key in order to collect the data!!

## General info about NASA Missions
"That's one small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind."

Apollo's Goals

The national effort that enabled Astronaut Neil Armstrong to speak those words as he stepped onto the lunar surface fulfilled a dream as old as humanity. Project Apollo's goals went beyond landing Americans on the moon and returning them safely to Earth. They included:

Establishing the technology to meet other national interests in space.
Achieving preeminence in space for the United States.
Carrying out a program of scientific exploration of the Moon.
Developing human capability to work in the lunar environment.
